# Software Incubator

Staging ground for ideas which are not yet ready to execute on and do not have their own repo, so
cannot be put into a software planner kanban  except as drafts.

The issue tracker of this repo can be used to create tickets and allow them to 'hatch'.
Once they acquire their own repos, these incubator issues can be closed or transferred.
